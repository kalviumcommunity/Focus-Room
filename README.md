# Focus Room – Distraction-Free Timer

Capstone Project Idea: Focus Room – Distraction-Free Timer

Idea Brief:
FocusRoom is a minimalistic, distraction-free productivity timer based on the Pomodoro technique. The goal is to help users stay focused and manage their time effectively by working in short, timed intervals (for example, 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of break). The app will have a clean and calming user interface that encourages deep work without unnecessary distractions.
Users can start, pause, or reset the timer and choose between different preset modes such as Work, Short Break, and Long Break. It is designed for students, remote workers, and anyone who wants to improve productivity with a simple and effective tool.

Core Features:
Start, Pause, and Reset timer functionality


Preset modes: Work (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), Long Break (15 minutes)


Audio notification or vibration when a session ends


Clean, distraction-free interface with subtle animations



Technologies / Concepts Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or optionally React)


Timer logic using setInterval or useEffect (if using React)


State management for time, mode, and control status


Optional: Local storage for theme or session history


Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
